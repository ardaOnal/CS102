working but in Eclipse IDE ( DrJava does not compile it and i couldnt fix it)

Integration & Testing of Hangman code: There were lots of compiler errors at the first place, 
most of the people incapable of completing their assignments correctly. 
There were some minor not initializing and spelling errors which is not a big deal.
Their algorithms had lots of logic errors which made me rewrite most of them. 
For example: 
-getKnownSoFar method didnt replace '*' chars with known letters.
-isGameOver method didn't work when we found out the entire word
-chooseSecretWord didn't do what it was supposed to do. It asked user to enter words and then randomly select a word from them.
-If we wrote a letter second time, it would still add it to usedLetters so i had to fix it. example: abcaaa
-getKnownSoFar method had a bug and wasn't checking the last index of the word, thus the last letter wasn't getting replaced at all. 
Now that is fixed but the game doesn't end when you guess the word correctly.
-We fixed the isGameOver method and changed StringBuffers to Strings so 
that when we use .equals on them to compare and now the game ends when you guess the word correctly.

I know that we are all beginner programmers and 
this was our first time doing this which makes it okay to do some mistakes
I am sure that we would be more successful with more practice in the future.
